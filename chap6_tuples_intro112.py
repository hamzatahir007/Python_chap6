# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immuteable, once a tuple is created it doest not update.
# data inside tuple

example = ("one" , "two" , "three")
#no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
#tuples are faster then list

#methods
# count, index
# len function
# slicing
print(example[:2])
